This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
This is a responsive Task Management application built with React and Framer Motion. The application allows users to add, filter, and manage tasks with a beautiful animated interface. Additionally, tasks are saved locally, so they persist after refreshing the page.

Features
Add Tasks: Add tasks with a label and description.
Mark as Complete: Toggle tasks as completed or incomplete.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list.
Task Filtering: Filter tasks to view all, completed, or incomplete tasks.
Task Details Modal: View a task's full details in a modal with a blurred background effect.
Local Storage Persistence: Tasks are saved in local storage and persist across page reloads.
Animations: Smooth animations on buttons, tasks, and modals using Framer Motion.
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
